## How it works

Four input pins and one output pin. Design simulates setup with 16 keys in form of binary numbers. Only one key can set the output pin to high
## How to test

Correct input number is 1001. All other combinations do not set the output pin to high
## External hardware

Input switches. Output LED (light)
